# Analysis of the Housing Market in Ames, Iowa

## Dataset Content

* The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data). We created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
* The dataset has almost 1.5 thousand rows and represents housing records from Ames, Iowa, indicating house profile (Floor Area, Basement, Garage, Kitchen, Lot, Porch, Wood Deck, Year Built) and its respective sale price for houses built between 1872 and 2010.

## Business Requirements

As a good friend, you are requested by your friend, who has received an inheritance from a deceased great-grandfather located in Ames, Iowa, to  help in maximising the sales price for the inherited properties.

Although your friend has an excellent understanding of property prices in her own state and residential area, she fears that basing her estimates for property worth on her current knowledge might lead to inaccurate appraisals. What makes a house desirable and valuable where she comes from might not be the same in Ames, Iowa. She found a public dataset with house prices for Ames, Iowa, and will provide you with that.

* 1 - The client is interested in discovering how the house attributes correlate with the sale price. Therefore, the client expects data visualisations of the correlated variables against the sale price to show that.
* 2 - The client is interested in predicting the house sale price from her four inherited houses and any other house in Ames, Iowa.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

* Project hypothesis(es) and how they will ve validated will be added in the future version of the project.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

* To be added in the future version of the project: A list of business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks.

## ML Business Case

* To be added in the future version of the project.

## Unfixed Bugs

* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

### Heroku

* The App live link is: <https://house-prices-3badc716b127.herokuapp.com>
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.

4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file. You may also demove the redundant files from the repository. 

## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries

* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide example(s) of how you used these libraries.
